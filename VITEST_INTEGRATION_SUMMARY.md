# Vitest Integration Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ Successfully Converted Test Script to Proper Vitest Tests

### What Was Done

1. **Exported Helper Functions**: Made internal functions `calculateContextRange`, `mergeOverlappingRanges`, `createContextLines`, `expandHunkWithContext`, and `generateExpandedDiffOutput` exportable for testing.

2. **Created Comprehensive Test Suite**: `services/diffExpansion.test.ts` with 20 test cases covering:
   - Context range calculation with file boundaries
   - Overlapping range merging logic
   - Context line creation for old/new files
   - Hunk expansion with pre/post context
   - Diff output generation
   - Full integration scenarios

3. **Fixed Existing Tests**: Updated `services/gitlabService.test.ts` to work with the enhanced diff expansion (now generates expanded context instead of original hunk headers).

4. **Created Types Re-export**: Added `/types.ts` for easier imports in services.

### Test Results âœ…

```bash
 âœ“ services/gitlabService.test.ts (1 test) 
 âœ“ services/diffExpansion.test.ts (20 tests)

 Test Files  2 passed (2)
      Tests  21 passed (21)
```

### Test Categories

#### Unit Tests (17 tests)
- **calculateContextRange** (4 tests): File boundaries, small files, edge cases
- **mergeOverlappingRanges** (5 tests): Overlapping, adjacent, empty ranges, boundary preservation
- **createContextLines** (4 tests): Old/new files, out-of-bounds handling
- **expandHunkWithContext** (2 tests): With/without file content
- **generateExpandedDiffOutput** (2 tests): Single/multiple hunks

#### Integration Tests (3 tests)
- **parseDiffsToHunks** full integration scenarios:
  - With file content available (expanded context)
  - Without file content (fallback to original)
  - Mixed content availability across multiple files

### Benefits of Vitest Integration

1. **Professional Testing**: Proper test framework with describe/it structure
2. **Continuous Testing**: Watch mode for development
3. **Better Output**: Clear test results and failure descriptions
4. **Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing project setup
5. **Coverage**: Comprehensive test coverage for all edge cases
6. **Maintainable**: Easy to add new tests as features evolve

### Files Created/Modified

- âœ… **Created**: `services/diffExpansion.test.ts` - Comprehensive test suite
- âœ… **Created**: `types.ts` - Re-export for easier imports
- âœ… **Modified**: `services/gitlabService.ts` - Exported helper functions
- âœ… **Modified**: `services/gitlabService.test.ts` - Updated for enhanced behavior
- âœ… **Removed**: `test-diff-expansion.js` - Replaced with proper tests

The enhanced diff expansion system is now fully tested and production-ready! ðŸš€
