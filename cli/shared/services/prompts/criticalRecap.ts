ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL RECAP - FINAL VERIFICATION BEFORE SUBMITTING:**

**ðŸŽ¯ DECISION PROCESS (FOLLOW EXACTLY):**
For each potential feedback item, ask:
1. Is this exact issue already mentioned in existing comments? â†’ SKIP IT
2. Is this similar to any existing comment topic? â†’ SKIP IT  
3. Is this a genuinely new issue not covered above? â†’ INCLUDE IT
4. When in doubt â†’ SKIP IT (better safe than duplicate)

** Final Checklist (MANDATORY VERIFICATION):**
- âœ… **DUPLICATE CHECK**: Read existing comments and confirmed NO overlaps
- âœ… **ZERO TOLERANCE**: Removed any feedback similar to existing comments
- âœ… Used exact file paths from headers
- âœ… Used exact line numbers from FULL FILE CONTENT
- âœ… Counted suggestion lines correctly (-x+y)
- âœ… **QUALITY GATE**: Only included genuinely NEW and valuable feedback
- âœ… **FINAL DECISION**: If no new issues found, used empty feedback array

**REMEMBER: Empty feedback array with "Code looks good!" summary is PERFECT when existing comments are comprehensive**
